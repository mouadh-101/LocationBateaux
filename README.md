## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **web platform for boat rental**, allowing users to:

- Search for boats based on filters (type, price, availability)
- Book boats by selecting dates
- View booking history from their user dashboard
- Simulate payments (future integrations: Clicktopay Tunisia, PayPal Dubai)

The application also includes a **multi-role access system**:  
`Guest`, `Client`, `Manager`, `Administrator`.
